        <h2>About Tesla Solar Roofs</h2>
<p>
Tesla Energy manufactures, installs and sells a solar shingle product it calls the Tesla Solar 
Roof. Solar shingles are small solar panel tiles that can make up an entire roof surface.The 
company claims that a Solar Roof costs less than installing a new roof with solar panels and that
the tempered glass that the tiles are made of are more durable than standard roofing tiles. The 
product was first unveiled in August 2016, but Tesla was only able to start producing the Solar 
Roof in volume in March 2020.A report released in March 2023 estimates that Tesla has installed 
approximately 3,000 solar roofs in the U.S. since the launch of the product in 2016, far below 
initial sales projections.[62] Other reports indicate that homeowners who sign up for the Solar 
Roof often get put on long waitlists.
