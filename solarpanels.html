    <h2>About Tesla Solar Panels</h2>
<p>
Tesla Energy sells and installs traditional solar panels on existing roofs, which the company 
calls "retrofit solar systems" (as opposed to its Solar Roof Tiles).[52] Unlike the company's 
other products, Tesla Energy does not build its own solar panels. As of April 2022, the company 
uses private label Tesla-branded solar panels built under contract by Qcells. Previously Tesla 
used panels from Panasonic as part of a larger partnership between the companies until Panasonic 
exited the solar business in January 2021.The company focuses primarily on residential customers
who purchase the system with cash or financing. Tesla Energy also offers systems to commercial 
customers in California.Tesla Energy does not have a lease program like SolarCity, but between 
August 2019 and May 2021, it offered "subscription" systems to customers in Arizona, California,
Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New Mexico, in a plan to boost residential solar 
deployments.As opposed to a lease, customers did not need to sign a long-term agreement and may 
ask Tesla to deactivate the system at anytime with no penalty; Tesla charges a flat fee to 
remove the system.Tesla uses proprietary mounting hardware on rooftops that eliminates the need 
for mounting rails and utilizes skirts that hide the hardware and make the panels appear to be 
flush with the roof.[56][57] SolarCity acquired the mounting technology when it purchased Zep 
Solar in 2013. The "railless" system allows installers to install solar panels on the roof more 
quickly than other installation approaches. Traditionally, solar panel installation requires 
workers to first outfit roofs with mounting rails and then attach solar panels to those rails.
