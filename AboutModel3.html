        <h2>About Tesla Model 3</h2>
<p>
The Tesla Model 3 is a battery electric compact executive car with a fastback body style built
by Tesla, Inc. since 2017. The Model 3 was marketed as being more affordable to more people than
previous models by Tesla. The Model 3 was the world's top selling plug-in electric car for three
years, from 2018 to 2020, before being knocked from the top spot by the Tesla Model Y, a 
crossover SUV based on the Model 3 chassis. In June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric 
car to pass global sales of 1 million. A refresh of the Tesla Model 3 was introduced in 2023, 
offering a revised exterior and interior.Within a week of unveiling the Model 3 in 2016, Tesla
revealed they had taken 325,000 reservations for the car. These reservations represented 
potential sales of over US$14 billion.By August 2017, there were 455,000 net reservations.
