    <h2>About Tesla Model Y</h2>
<p>
The Tesla Model Y is a battery electric mid-size crossover SUV built by Tesla, Inc. since 2020.
The Model Y is based on the Model 3 sedan platform.[6] It shares an estimated 75 percent of its 
parts with the Tesla Model 3,[7] which includes a similar interior and exterior design and 
electric powertrain. The Model Y fills a smaller and less expensive segment than the mid-sized 
Tesla Model X.[8] Like the Model X, the Model Y offers optional third-row seats for a seven 
passenger seating capacity.Unveiled in March 2019,it started production at its Fremont Factory 
in January 2020,[13] and started deliveries on March 13, 2020.In the first and second quarters of
2023, the Model Y outsold the Toyota Corolla to become the world's best-selling car, the first 
ever electric vehicle to claim the title.he Model Y is Tesla's first vehicle to use a heat pump 
instead of electric resistance for interior cabin heating.[50][51] Electric cars using electric 
resistance heating can lose 40% or more of their range in ambient temperatures below 20 °F 
(−7 °C). The heat pump can be up to 300% more efficient than electric resistance heating.
